# Gaussian_Elimination_Program

Gaussian elimination, also known as row reduction, is an algorithm in linear algebra for solving a system of linear equations. It is usually understood as a sequence of operations performed on the corresponding matrix of coefficients. This method can also be used to find the rank of a matrix, to calculate the determinant of a matrix, and to calculate the inverse of an invertible square matrix.
This program has the user input a positive whole number, and then it outputs a randomly generated matrix, a randomly generated vector, and the solution vector as 'x'. It is written in python and requires the random import to use.
